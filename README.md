# 🏥 Bakker — AI-Powered Early Medical Diagnosis Assistant

**Bakker** is an intelligent early-diagnosis assistant designed to provide users with fast, reliable, and AI-driven health insights. The system analyzes user-reported symptoms and predicts the most likely diseases using machine learning models—delivering results in seconds with a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.

## 📋 Project Overview

**Bakker** addresses the challenge of slow or unclear early medical assessment.
Users simply enter their symptoms ➡️ the system processes the data ➡️ and returns a clear, explainable preliminary diagnosis along with helpful recommendations.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🧬 **AI-based symptom analysis** to predict probable diseases
* 📊 **Probability scores** for each prediction
* ⚡ **Instant recommendations** based on the model’s output
* 🔍 **Explainability** (why the model chose this prediction)
* 🛠️ **Admin Dashboard** to monitor users and prediction logs
* 🔐 **Secure authentication** using Firebase
* 🌐 **REST API** built for integration with external systems

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out?

✅ **Real medical dataset** with proper cleaning & feature engineering.
✅ **Full data pipeline:** Cleaning → EDA → Modeling → Evaluation → API.
✅ **Production-ready structure** with authentication & role-based access.
✅ **Strong demonstration** of applied AI in the healthcare domain.
✅ **Perfect for portfolio**, interviews, and practical experience.
