🔥 Bakker — AI-Powered Early Medical Diagnosis Assistant

Bakker is an intelligent early-diagnosis assistant designed to provide users with fast, reliable, and AI-driven health insights.
The system analyzes user-reported symptoms and predicts the most likely diseases using machine learning models—delivering results in seconds with a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.

🎯 Project Overview

Bakker addresses the challenge of slow or unclear early medical assessment.
Users simply enter their symptoms → the system processes the data → and returns a clear, explainable preliminary diagnosis along with helpful recommendations.

⸻

🧠 Key Features
 • AI-based symptom analysis to predict probable diseases
 • Probability scores for each prediction
 • Instant recommendations based on the model’s output
 • Explainability (why the model chose this prediction)
 • Admin Dashboard to monitor users and prediction logs
 • Secure authentication using Firebase
 • REST API built for integration with external systems

⚙️ Tech Stack

Front-End
 • React / Next.js
 • TypeScript
 • TailwindCSS

Back-End
 • Python
 • Flask / FastAPI
 • Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (depending on the model version)

Database & Auth
 • Firebase Authentication
 • Firestore Database
 • Cleaned & structured medical datasets (Symptoms → Diseases → Treatments)

Deployment
 • GitHub (source code)
 • (Optional for future) Vercel for Front-End, Render for API

⸻

💡 Why This Project Stands Out
 • Real medical dataset with proper cleaning & feature engineering
 • Full data pipeline: Cleaning → EDA → Modeling → Evaluation → API
 • Production-ready structure with authentication & role-based access
 • Strong demonstration of applied AI in the healthcare domain
 • Perfect for portfolio, interviews, and practical experience
